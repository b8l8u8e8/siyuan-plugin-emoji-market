## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open the Emoji Panel** in SiYuan  
   (Click the document's emoji button or type `:` in the text)
2. **Enter Keywords** in the search box  
   Results from both platforms will immediately appear in the **"Emoji Market"** section below the built-in results.
3. **Click any icon** to open the preview dialog  
   View author details, license, colors, and more.
4. **Choose a custom color** 🎨 or keep the original color as needed.
5. Check the confirmation box and click **"Use Now"**.
6. The icon is **saved locally and applied automatically** ✅ — no additional clicks required.

🔒 **Storage Note:** Emojis are loaded dynamically and are not written to local storage until you confirm your selection. Browsing and previewing are handled entirely in memory and cleared upon closing, leaving no cache residue.

## 📂 Icon Storage Location

Icons you choose to use will be saved as SVG files in SiYuan's standard custom emoji directories:

- `data/emojis/iconfont/` — From Iconfont (Alibaba)
- `data/emojis/cainiao/` — From Cainiao Icons

These are standard SiYuan custom emoji files.  
They will be retained and display normally in the emoji panel even if the plugin is uninstalled.
