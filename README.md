## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open the emoji panel** in SiYuan  
   (Click the emoji button on a document or type `:` in the editor).
2. **Enter keywords** in the search bar.  
   Results from both platforms will appear instantly in the **"Emoji Market"** section below the built-in results.
3. **Click any icon** to open the preview dialog.  
   View author details, license agreements, and color information.
4. **Choose a custom color** 🎨 or keep the original.
5. **Check the confirmation box** and click **"Use Now"**.
6. The icon is **saved locally and applied automatically** ✅ — no further clicks required.

🔒 **Storage Note:** Emojis are dynamically loaded and will not be written to local storage until you confirm your selection. Browsing and previewing are handled entirely in memory; everything is cleared upon closing, leaving no cache behind.

## 📂 Storage Location

Icons you choose to use are saved as SVG files in SiYuan's standard custom emoji directories:

- `data/emojis/iconfont/` — From Alibaba Iconfont
- `data/emojis/cainiao/` — From Cainiao Icons

These are standard SiYuan custom emoji files.  
They will remain and function normally in the emoji panel even if the plugin is uninstalled.  

The plugin itself does not store any configuration or other data.
